# HarvardX's Data Science Professional Certificate

This repo contains files from my learning process on Data Science with R. All files were created based on the classes from edX courses, teached by Rafael A. Irizarry. More informations about the professional certificate can be found [here](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science)

## Environment

I used Anaconda to create an environment with all the packages needed for the execution of the notebooks.
Instructions for the installation of Anaconda can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
To create an environment based on the dspc.yaml file, run the following code on your terminal:

```sh
$ conda env create -f dspc.yaml
```

## Notebooks

To properly open the notebooks, the environment must be activated and a jupyter navigator must be opened:

```sh
$ conda activate dspc
(dspc) $ jupyter notebook
```
